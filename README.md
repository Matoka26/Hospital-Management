# Goal
Create a Rest API app to handle main activities in a hospital involving: Doctors, Patients, Assistants, and Treatments. The system should manage all those activities with the corresponding security in place. The ACL will contain 3 main roles: General Manager (has access to all activities), Doctor (has access to all his patients and can define new ones), and Assistant (has access to allocated patients, one patient can have multiple assistants). 
Any management module, like Doctor Management, Patient Management â€¦,  should have CRUD capabilities



The API should have the following components exposed:

- [ ] Login
- [ ] Doctor Management (done by the General manager)
- [ ] Patient management (done by Doctor or General manager)
- [ ] Assistant management (done by the General manager)
- [ ] Treatment management (done by Doctor or General manager)
- [ ] The treatment recommended by a doctor to a Patient (done by the Doctor)
- [ ] Patient assignment to an Assistant (done by Doctor or General manager)
- [ ] Treatment applied by an Assistant (Assistant only)
- [ ] A report containing the list of all the Doctors and the associated patients and a section for statistics data (JSON) (accessed by the General manager)
- [ ] A report with all the treatments applied to a Patient (JSON) (accessed by the General manager or Doctor)

> **NOTE:**    
> I've had issues implementing and testing the endpoints, so I've only made CRUD operations disregarding the role conditions

# Requirements
- [x] You can use any framework you like (Django REST framework)
- [ ] Data must be persistent even if the server receives successive restarts.
- [ ] The module should expose all basic functionalities described in the goal
- [ ] Minimal test coverage for unit and integration test
- [x] Include migration and fixture files
- [ ] Document the vulnerabilities that may appear 
 
> **NOTE:**  
> This api is an open wound

# Bonus (optional, but nice to have)
- [ ] Use docker to run your application
- [ ] Deploy the application over the internet
- [ ] Document the API using the Open API standards




The <b><i>conceptual schema</i></b> and the <b><i>entity/relationship schema</i></b> can be found in the <b><i>Hospital Diagram.drawio</b></i> file and can be opened with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

### Current root directoy
```
    hospital-\  <-- Root directory
        backend\
            docker\
            ...
             >requirements.txt
        >.gitignore
        >docker-compose.yml
        >env.template
        >Hospital Diagram.drawio
        >README.md
        >server.py
```

## 1. Installing dependencies  

Open a terminal to create the <b>virtual environment</b> called <b><i>venv</i></b>.

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the <b>virtual environment</b>.
```
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On UNIX
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies.
```
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Additionally (not mandatory) upgrade pip.
```
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Create a new <b><i>env</i></b> file to store informations specific to our working environment.
```
# On Windows
copy env.template .env

# On UNIX
cp env.template .env
```

## 2. Run Server


### Current root directoy
```
    hospital-\  <-- Root directory
        backend\
            core\
            ...
             >requirements.txt
        venv\
        >.env
        >.gitignore
        >docker-compose.yml
        >env.template
        >Hospital Diagram.drawio
        >README.md
        >server.py
```

Change directory to the backend.
```
cd backend
```

Migrate (the migration already exist in backend/core/migrations/0001_initial.py).
```
python manage.py migrate  
```

Run server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

CTRL + Clink on the URL [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

> **NOTE:**  
> After changing anything regarding the structure of the models run the following commands to make a new migration and migrate
>```
>python manage.py makemigrations
>python manage.py migrate  
>```


## 3. Admin Panel
To creat an admin run
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
On the following prompts provide:
- Username (otherwise it will be auto-complited with the the name of the current User of the machine)
- Email address
- Password
- Password (again)


To access the admin panel add <b><i>/admin/</i></b> to the end of the URL.  

Login with the <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b>  
  
You now have access to the <b>admin panel</b> and can operate <b>CRUD</b> operations on the models of the app with more ease.

## 4. URLs
You can access a view for each model by adding <b><i>/core/modelName/</b></i> to the end of the URL.  
On this interface is exposed a field where you can 
- <b><i>POST</b></i> new data to the model's table
- <b><i>GET</b></i> existing data (click the top right button)  
  
To use the <b><i>GET(by id), PUT, PATCH, DELETE</b></i> endpoints you must add the <b><i>/id</b></i> at the end of the URL.   
(Also use an external app such as <b>[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)</b> to process the requests.)  
  
  Example:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/core/user/a3c9f5f1-2b55-4ec8-a312-7f85f506c9f2
```
